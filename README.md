Ikra is an array-based parallel extension to Ruby with dynamic compilation. The high-level goal of the Ikra project is to allow developers to exploit GPU-based high-performance computing without paying much attention to details of the underlying GPU infrastructure and CUDA. This is the Ruby version of Ikra  (Ikra implemented in Ruby).
